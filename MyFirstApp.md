I created my first "Hello World" app by following this link:
       https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/creating-project 
Android studio did not detect my LG Nexus 5 the first time. As a result, it was displaying an error message that I was having a low  API level.
I ran the app a second time, and it worked.

I am still getting a warning:if I run the same app as another user on the phone, the app may crash. I should always run the app on the primary user only.
