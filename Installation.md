I installed android studio on debian 9 by seeing another github repository:
         https://github.com/initforcode/android-workshop 
while installing this, I also installed kvm to accelerate machine speed by:
         https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/install-kvm-server-debian-linux-9-headless-server/
         
Each time, in order to start the application; I need to go to the bin directory in android-studio and run the "studio.sh" file.
